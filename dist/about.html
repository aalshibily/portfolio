          <p>
            I went to The University of Nebraska at Omaha for a Bachelor's
            degree in Computer Science. Somewhere along my path, I found a
            passion for all sorts of code creations. I started out with small
            projects involving making 2D game ideas and turning those ideas into
            code. I moved on to 3D using the Unity game engine and made a tower
            defense game. Now, I've found a passion for creating content and
            problem solving through Web Development. I've taught myself to
            handle both ends of a Web Development cycle, Front-End, Back-end and
            anything in-between.

          <p>
            I fell in love with this one while working on one of my first
            projects. Very similar to Java which made my transition even better.
            A common language used in game development especially if you're
            using the Unity game engine.

        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            This is the bread and butter of any Web Developer. You'll need to
            know JS if you're gonna work on any web-based projects. There's also
            a lot of great libraries that support it. I personally love using JS
            with Node.js on my favorite IDE Visual Studio Code.
          </p>

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3>ASP.NET / MVC</h3>
          <p>
            Another great framework to work with that comes complete with
            everything you need right out the box. Easy to use and implement,
            great functionality with no complexity. The MVC scheme takes out a
            lot of the complexity and leaves you to focus on the project.

        Please also be aware that the list above does NOT reflect everything I
        know or am familiar with but rather it's a small and handpicked few that
        I personally wanted to feature.
